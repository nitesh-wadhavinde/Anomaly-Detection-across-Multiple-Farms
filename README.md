# Anomaly-Detection-across-Multiple-Farms
An anomaly across multiple farms can be defined as a farm whose growth is not the same as its
neighbouring farms, with nearby sowing dates. Anomaly detection across multiple farms can help
detect early signs of crop diseases, enabling corrective actions before the disease spreads leading to
improved crop yields. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellites and drones, can capture images
and data on crops and the surrounding environment from a distance, providing farmers with realtime
information on crop growth. By making more informed decisions based on anomaly detection
through satellite images, farmers can achieve better crop yields, increased profits, and more sustainable
agriculture.
